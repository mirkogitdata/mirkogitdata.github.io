<h2>Portfolio description</h2>

The project consists of several parts,
which make up the portfolio.

In respositor you can find <em>HTML, CSS, SCSS, JS</em> files
with two directories containing image files <em>jpg</em> and <em>png.</em>

The website was developed using <em>HTML5 and SASS / LESS</em> preprocessor technology
or super css technique, which is located on the Ruby platform.
 
 <strong>It consists of three writings:</strong>
- <em>style.scss</em>
- <em>variable.scss</em>
- <em>grid_system.scss</em>

In the compilation process we get the <em>style.css file</em>,
which is located on the <em>index.html</em> page.
he head tag contain source fonts for the font.
Then aos, jquery, animatescroll codes for site integration.

At the bottom of the page are four JavaScript files,
which perform the functions I have rendered.
And at the very end is <em>aos.init ()</em>,
which causes you to perform the animation feature on the page.

In the portfolio section there are 6 products,
which open links to three <em>html</em> pages and three <em>pdf</em> pages.

I did not use the Boostrap framework because I wanted to highlight my <em>SASS/LESS</em> capabilities
and using GRID for a vised-dimensional layout.

The site is developed with semantic tags in <em>html.</em>
For better <em>SEO</em> placement. It is also optimized on the <em>PNG, JPG</em> file size.
It is customizable for many device with responsive lines of code(media queries variables and GRID system).
Because we are in the first period of mobile displaying.

In short, about my portfolio.
