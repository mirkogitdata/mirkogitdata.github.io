<h2>Portfolio description</h2>

The project consists of several parts,
which make up the portfolio.

In respositor you can find <em>HTML, CSS, SCSS, JS</em> files
with two directories containing image files jpg and png.

The website was developed using <em>HTML5 and SASS / LESS</em> preprocessor technology
or super css technique, which is located on the Ruby platform.
 
 <strong>It consists of three writings:</strong>
- <em>style.scss</em>
- <em>variable.scss</em>
- <em>grid_system.scss</em>

In the compilation process we get the <em>style.css file</em>,
which is located on the index.html page.

The head tag contain source fonts for the font.
Then aos, jquery, animatescroll codes for site integration.

At the bottom of the page are four JavaScript files,
which perform the functions I have rendered.
And at the very end is aos.init (),
which causes you to perform the animation feature on the page.

In the portfolio section there are 6 products,
which open links to three html pages and three pdf pages.

I did not use the Boostrap framework because I wanted to highlight my CSS3, SCSS capabilities
and using GRID for a vised-dimensional layout.

The site is developed with semantic tags in html.
For better SEO placement. It is also optimized on the PNG, JPG file size.
It is customizable for many devices,
because we are in the first period of mobile imaging.

In short, about my portfolio.
